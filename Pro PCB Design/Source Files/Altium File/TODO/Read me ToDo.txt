Here describe all the things which have to be improved or done in the next revision.

Schematic:
Block diagram - change i2c4 with i2c2
Delete a note about sdckeo resistor (page DDR3)
fit R65 - connect RGMII reset
fit Q9 - connect boot mode signal to the B2B connector
Replace R103 and R104 with lower value (stronger pullup). Check if 4k99 will be enought.
Add note to schematic: pins for SD3 can be used as CAN, pins for Audio can be used for another SPI

PCB:


Production:


Firmware:
update the file in linux/arch/arm/mach-mx6/board-mx6q_sabresd - add a support for lvds vga displays.
